										<header><h4>Ment_Amiga - Mental Health Chatbot to Address the Psychological Impact of Modern Stressors​ 
										</h4>
									</header>
										<p>The escalating global concern surrounding mental health issues has been accentuated by a
myriad of stressors originating from contemporary societal dynamics.
										Our approach encompasses addressing the stigma and barriers associated with traditional mental
health care, acknowledging the reluctance of individuals to seek professional help due to fear of
judgment or vulnerability. <br>
										The final product is an AI-powered Mental Health Chatbot that delivered accessible, anonymous, and stigma-free mental health support. This chatbot employed AI-driven emotional support, offered guidance on self-help strategies, and, when necessary, facilitated connections to professional help. A key differentiator amongst our competitors was the facility to assess the user's distress level, provide tailored solutions, such as recommending remedies, connecting with helplines, and alerting loved ones. By developing a mental health solution, we took a holistic approach to mitigate the psychological toll of modern-day stressors and supported mental well-being across diverse demographics.</p>

										<header><h4>Full stack serverless Flask based application using AWS lambda and zappa for renting devices from the lab using DynamoDB for storage
										</h4>
									</header>
										<p>We created a Cloud Lab Inventory management project that allows for the electronic storage and management of device information, making it easier for both users and Lab Inventory administrators to track and locate devices. This eliminates the need for manual work and reduces the chances of errors. The system consists of two modules, one for administrators and one for users, who can register, issue, rent and renew devices, and contact the Lab Inventory team for any queries. AWS services were used to develop this project, including AWS Lambda, Zappa, S3, DynamoDB, and SES</p>

										<header><h4>Developed an elastic Flask based web application with memory cache pool on Amazon EC2
										</h4>
									<p> Cloud Computing</p></header>
										
										<p>A web front end that allows users to upload a new key and image, uniquely identifying the image. The system stores the image in the local file system and adds the key to the database. Users can update or delete the stored key and image. A page displays all available keys and images, with a button to clear the application of all keys and values. Additionally, there is an option to configure and display statistics for the mem-cache, including capacity, replacement policy, and cache clearance.
											The application consists of four components implemented as a separate Flask instance-
										<ol>	<li>A pool of memcache nodes, each of which is an independent EC2 instance</li>
											<li>A manager-app that controls the size of the memcache pool</li>
											<li>An auto-scaler component that automatically resizes the memcache pool based on configuration values set by the manager-app. It monitors the miss rate of the memcache pool by getting this information using the AWS CloudWatch API</li>
											<li>Frontend app</li>

										</h4>
									<p> Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies</p></header>
										
										<p>The Pet-Shop DApp project is a blockchain-based application that has been developed by utilizing tutorials such as pet shop and elections. Used Ganache to fire up an Ethereum blockchain and connected it with MetaMask. Truffle was used to develop the DApp and write smart contracts for sending ether, voting for favorite pet and adopting a pet along with frontend enhancements like enhanced UI. The project includes all the functionalities of the tutorials with additional features incorporated into the pet shop template. Once the user enters the pet store, they can choose and adopt a dog of their choice and pay for it. The project also includes a donation feature where the user can donate Ether to the store. The user's account information is displayed on the welcome message, and the Pet Shop Status panel shows the number of clients in the shop, the total number of pets adopted, and the number of pets the user has adopted. Additionally, users can vote for their favorite pet, and the total number of votes each pet has received is displayed on the webpage. The UI of the project has been modified to include calming colors, a header, and a navigation bar for easy access to the donation portal and main shop page.
