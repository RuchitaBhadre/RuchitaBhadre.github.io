										<header><h4>Full stack serverless Flask based application using AWS lambda and zappa for renting devices from the lab using DynamoDB for storage
										</h4>
									</header>
										<p>We created a Cloud Lab Inventory management project that allows for the electronic storage and management of device information, making it easier for both users and Lab Inventory administrators to track and locate devices. This eliminates the need for manual work and reduces the chances of errors. The system consists of two modules, one for administrators and one for users, who can register, issue, rent and renew devices, and contact the Lab Inventory team for any queries. AWS services were used to develop this project, including AWS Lambda, Zappa, S3, DynamoDB, and SES</p>

										<header><h4>Developed an elastic Flask based web application with memory cache pool on Amazon EC2
										</h4>
									<p> Cloud Computing</p></header>
										
										<p>A web front end that allows users to upload a new key and image, uniquely identifying the image. The system stores the image in the local file system and adds the key to the database. Users can update or delete the stored key and image. A page displays all available keys and images, with a button to clear the application of all keys and values. Additionally, there is an option to configure and display statistics for the mem-cache, including capacity, replacement policy, and cache clearance.
											The application consists of four components implemented as a separate Flask instance-
										<ul>	<li>A pool of memcache nodes, each of which is an independent EC2 instance</li>
											<li>A manager-app that controls the size of the memcache pool</li>
											<li>An auto-scaler component that automatically resizes the memcache pool based on configuration values set by the manager-app. It monitors the miss rate of the memcache pool by getting this information using the AWS CloudWatch API</li>
											<li>Frontend app</li>

									<p> Intelligent Sensor Networks</p></header>
										
										<p>The main objective of the project was to develop a low-level and user-friendly 
system that resembled the functionalities of an off-the-shelf gas monitoring system. 
The primary focus was to reduce the cost of the developed system as compared to 
											the typical modules (e.g., Honeywell’s E3 Point)<br><a href="https://github.com/RuchitaBhadre/Monitoring-harmful-emissions-noise-levels-and-fuel-leakages-in-parking-lots" target="_blank">Report</a></p>

from a larger model to a smaller one that can be used practically in real-world settings.The
project focused on the setting of Knowledge distillation as a model compression technique.<br>Project Repo: <a href= "https://github.com/RuchitaBhadre/Knowledge-Distillation-for-Building-Lightweight-Deep-Learning-Models" target="_blank">https://github.com/RuchitaBhadre/Knowledge-Distillation-for-Building-Lightweight-Deep-Learning-Models</a></p>
